* I want to separate common functionality into separate classes, things like getTileBy#particular method#, also all the events ariving from the server, they should all be in one place. I want all these separate classes to "extends" my main game class but i dont know how to do it without that weir error about prototype and can not be undefined.

* Is there a better way to manage tile explosion hitting a player so that it doesnt have to involve gameController, what is the defined purpose/role of gameController



movement
while arrow is held down move action will continue to fire ever half sec
when key is released move event will stop firing

player can press and release to quickly restart the move interval so that there is no interval
- to stop the payer from doing this, every time a move order is issues a timer goes on that the player cant issue another move command for another half a seccond
