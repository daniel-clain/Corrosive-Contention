* I want to separate common functionality into separate classes, things like getTileBy#particular method#, also all the events ariving from the server, they should all be in one place. I want all these separate classes to "extends" my main game class but i dont know how to do it without that weir error about prototype and can not be undefined.

* Is there a better way to manage tile explosion hitting a player so that it doesnt have to involve gameService, what is the defined purpose/role of gameService



movement
while arrow is held down move action will continue to fire ever half sec
when key is released move event will stop firing

player can press and release to quickly restart the move interval so that there is no interval
- to stop the payer from doing this, every time a move order is issues a timer goes on that the player cant issue another move command for another half a seccond


?when should the other players get an update?
when a tree is removed
when a tree explodes - send items dropped
when player moves
when player changes facing direction
when a player throws a bomb
when items are picked up
when a player dies
when a tree is siphoned
when a player goes invisible
when a player uses an ability


all essence colours appear on the hud with dimmed brightness, 
when the essence color you just picked up is now enough for one of the upgrades
then the color of the essence orb jumps up to becoming larger size, more vivid color, and slightly levitates a bit more

given a user selects one of the glowing essence
then all the upgrades for that essence colour will show above that glowing essencce
and only the upgrades are affordable will be enabled

when an upgrade is selected, 
then the right number of essence points will be subtracted from the respective color
and the upgrades effect will registered within the game
and the upgrade will go up in level
and the relative glowing essence models will update its display based on the updated essence points
and the upgrade options will no longer be displayed



?what does the game do?
moves the board to center on the player
spawns trees

?what does a tile do?
renders game board entity
animates game board entity

?what does a bomb do?
travel in one direction
explode


?what can a tentacle do?
grab an enemy
can spawn
can despawn


Movement Logic
* when you hold a direction the player moves in that direction
* when you release they stop moving
* if a second key is held then the first button stops being pressed even if its still held
* if you hold a direction and are blocked from moving that direction then move will not fire
* once a player starts to move they can not move again until the move cycle is finished
